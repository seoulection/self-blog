One of my 2020 New Year's Resolutionsâ„¢ is to get into bread making. After gathering all of the equipment, my bread-making has been in full swing. Below are the steps that I took to create my first solo sourdough:

#### Ingredients

* 100g whole rye sourdough starter
* 310g water
* 450g strong white flour
* 8g salt

#### Steps

1. Add starter and water to bowl. Break up the starter inside the water.
2. Add flour and salt. Mix. Dough should be raggedy.
3. Spritz with water sprayer.
4. Rest for **30 minutes**.

#### First Fold

1. Spray surface, scraper, and hands with water.
2. Take dough out of bowl top-side-down onto surface.
3. Stretch out and fold 12 times.
4. Roll the dough over so that the seam is on the bottom.
5. Shape with hands and put the dough back into the bowl. Spritz the top with water and cover with a tea towel.
6. Rest for **2.5 hours.**

#### Second Fold

1. Spray surface, hands, and top of dough with water.
2. Stretch out dough 6 times and repeat previous steps 4-6.

#### Preshape

1. Dust surface and top of dough with flour.
2. Take dough out of bowl top-side-down onto surface.
3. Repeat previous step 2.
4. Dust the top of dough again with flour. Leave the dough on the surface and cover with a tea towel for **1.5 hours**.

#### Final Shape

1. Flip the dough so that the top is on the surface.
2. Stretch out carefully and do the "burrito fold."
3. Cover all surface area with flour.
4. Place into proving basket seam-side-up.
5. Put into refrigerator uncovered overnight.

#### Baking

1. Preheat oven to 445F with cloche inside for 30 minutes.
2. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it rest for 20 minutes.
3. Take the cloche out of the oven after 30 minutes, dust the bottom with flour and place the dough.
4. Score the top of the dough with a 45 degree angle.
5. Bake with lid on for **27 minutes** and with lid off for **21 minutes**.
6. Place the bread onto a cooling rack and let it rest for at least an hour.
7. Enjoy!
